# Movie Showcase Highlights

---

## Highlight something in your project that you thought was especially interesting or significant to your overall implementation.

For this role I wanted to showcase both my skills in Vue and PHP. I chose to develop this app using Laravel & Inertia with Vue3. This allows me to using all the great things from Vue while constructing back-end code in Laravel.

---

## Tell us what you are most pleased or proud of with your implementation.

-   I wanted to implement a feature where a signed in user could favorite a movie and save it in their favorites list. A non signed in user can still use the app to search, filter, review, etc. It's not 100% implemented but happy I got it working within the constraints. I set up the table, model, and requests to save and show favorites.

---

## Given more time, what next feature or improvement would you like to add to your project?

-   Given more time I would fine-tune the search and filter features and add their values to query parameters. The page and search result values populate, but I did not have enough time to fully get them working (refresh page / edit url).
-   When you save a favorite movie, flash message is suppose to show, but not working 100% best yet.

### Notes

-   Laravel comes with starter code to establish the profile, register, and login pages and logic. I updated these use some of the colors I was using, and adjusted routing urls back to the main movie gallery (home page) to get these working within the app.
